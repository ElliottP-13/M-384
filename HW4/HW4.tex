\problem{1} 7.3.4 Problem 2

Suppose $f_n \to f$ and all functions $f_n$ satisfy the Lipschitz condition
$|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| \leq M |x-y|$ for some constant $M$, independent of $n$.
Prove that $f$ also satisfies the same Lipschitz condition

\problem{2} 7.3.4 Problem 5

If $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n = f$ and the functions $f_n$ are all monotone increasing, must $f$ be monotone increasing?
What happens if $f_n$ are all strictly increasing?

\problem{3} 7.3.4 Problem 6

Give an example of a sequence of continuous functions converging pointwise to a function
with a discontinuity of the second kind.

\textbf{Hint:} Consider the common domain $\mathbb{D} = [0,1]$ and 
$$f_n (x) = \begin{cases}
    nx & 0 \leq x \leq 1/n \\
    1 & 1/n \leq x \leq 1 \\
\end{cases}$$

Find another function $g(x)$ which has a discontinuity of the second kind on $\mathbb{D}$ and define 
$g_n(x) = f_n(x) \cdot g(x)$
You need to prove that $g_n$ are continuous on $\mathbb{D}$ and converges pointwise to a function with a 
discontinuity of the second kind.

\problem{4} 7.3.4 Problem 7

If $|f_n(x)| \leq a_n$ for all $x$, and $\sum_{n = 1}^ \infty a_n$ converges,
prove that $\sum_{n = 1}^ \infty f_n(x)$ converges uniformly.

\textbf{Hint:}
The series $\sum_{n = 1}^ \infty f_n(x)$ converges uniformly is the equivalent to that the sequence
of partial sum functions $F_n(x) = \sum_{k = 1} ^n f_k(x)$ converges uniformly. 
Then prove $F_n$ satisfies the Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence (Theorem 7.3.1).
