\problem{1} 6.2.4 Problem 6

Prove that if $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$ and $g(x) = f(x)$ for
every $x$ except for a finite number, then $g$ is Riemann integrable.

\textbf{Hint:} Mimic the proof of Theorem 6.2.3

\problem{3} 6.2.4 Problem 10

If $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$ and continuous at $x_0$, prove
that $F(x) = \int_a ^x f(t) dt$ is differentiable at $x_0$ and $F'(x_0) = f(x_0)$.
Show that if $f$ has a jump discontinuity at $x_0$, then $F$ is not
differentiable at $x_0$. 

\textbf{Hint: } Refer to the proof of Theorem 6.1.2, note that $f(x)$ being continuous at $x_0$
can be written as $\forall 1/m, \sp \exists 1/n \sp st. \sp \forall x \in [a,b], \sp |x - x_0| < 1/n$, we have $|f(x) - f(x_0)| < 1/m$
or $f(x_0) - 1/m < f(x) < f(x_0) + 1/m$
