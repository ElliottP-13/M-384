\problem{1} 7.4.5 Problem 2

If $f$ is analytic in a neighborhood of $x_0$ and $f(x_0) = 0$, 
show that $f(x)/(x - x_0)$ is analytic in the same neighborhood.

\textbf{Hint:} Write $f(x)$ as a power series expanded at $x_0$ and pay attention to what is $a_0$

\begin{proof}
    
    Since $f$ is analytic around $x_0$ we can write it as the power series: 
    $f(x) = \sum{n=0} ^\infty a_n (x - x_0)^n = a_0 + a_1 (x - x_0) + a_2 (x - x_0)^2$.
    Then $f(x_0) = a_0 = 0$ by definition of $f$.  

    So then we can write it as $\sum{n=1} ^\infty a_n (x - x_0)^n = a_1 (x - x_0) + a_2 (x - x_0)^2$.
    We can divide by $x - x_0$: $\sum{n=1} ^\infty a_n (x - x_0)^{n-1}$.
    We then let $n' = n-1$ so we have\\
    $\frac{f(x)}{x-x_0} = \sum_{n'=0} ^\infty a_{n'+1} (x - x_0)^{n'}$
    which is a power series expansion about $x_0$.

    Then in order to show that they are analytic we just need to show that they have the same radius of convergence.
    Then by analytic continuation they are analytic on the same neighborhood $(x_0 - R, x_0 + R)$.
    We know that $\limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = 1/R$ by definition.
    We need to show that $\limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_{n+1}|^{1/n} = 1/R$

    \begin{align*}
        \limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_{n+1}|^{1/n} \\
        \limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_{n+1}|^{\frac{1}{n+1} \cdot \frac{n+1}{n}}\\
        \limsup_{n \to \infty} \left(|a_{n+1}|^{\frac{1}{n+1}}\right)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}\\
        \limsup_{n \to \infty} (1/R)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}\\
        1/R
    \end{align*}
    where the last step follows from $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n+1}{n} = 1$
\end{proof}






\problem{2} 7.4.5 Problem 6

Prove that if $f(x)$ is analytic on $(a,b)$, then $F(x) = \int_c ^x f(t)dt$ 
is also analytic onf $(a,b)$, where $c$ is any point in $(a,b)$

\textbf{Hint:} You need to prove that for any $x_0 \in (a,b)$, $F(x)$ has
a power series expansion about $x_0$ for $x$ close to $x_0$.
Now pick any fixed $x_0 \in (a,b)$ and write $F(x)$ as:

$$F(x) = \int_c ^x f(t) dt = \int_c ^{x_0} f(t) dt + \int_{x_0} ^x f(t) dt = C_0 + \int_{x_0} ^x f(t)dt$$
