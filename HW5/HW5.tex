\problem{1} 7.4.5 Problem 2

If $f$ is analytic in a neighborhood of $x_0$ and $f(x_0) = 0$, 
show that $f(x)/(x - x_0)$ is analytic in the same neighborhood.

\textbf{Hint:} Write $f(x)$ as a power series expanded at $x_0$ and pay attention to what is $a_0$

\problem{2} 7.4.5 Problem 6

Prove that if $f(x)$ is analytic on $(a,b)$, then $F(x) = \int_c ^x f(t)dt$ 
is also analytic onf $(a,b)$, where $c$ is any point in $(a,b)$

\textbf{Hint:} You need to prove that for any $x_0 \in (a,b)$, $F(x)$ has
a power series expansion about $x_0$ for $x$ close to $x_0$.
Now pick any fixed $x_0 \in (a,b)$ and write $F(x)$ as:

$$F(x) = \int_c ^x f(t) dt = \int_c ^{x_0} f(t) dt + \int_{x_0} ^x f(t) dt = C_0 + \int_{x_0} ^x f(t)dt$$

\problem{4}

Compute the radius of convergence of the following power series:

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item $\sum (n^4/n!) \cdot x^n$
    \item $\sum \sqrt{n} x^n$
    \item $(n^2 2^n) x^n$
