\problem{1} 7.6.3 Problem 2

If $|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| \leq M |x - y|^\alpha$ for some fixed $M$ and $\alpha > 0$
and all $x,y$ in a compact interval. Show that $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly
equicontinuous

\hrule

\begin{proof}
    
    By definition of uniform equicontinuity we need to show:
    $\forall 1/m \sp \exists 1/n \sp st \sp |x - y| < 1/n \implies |f_k(x) - f_k(y)| < 1/m \sp \forall k$
    We have from the definition of $f_n$ that $|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| \leq M |x - y|^\alpha$,
    So $|f_k(x) - f_k(y)| \leq M |x - y|^\alpha \leq M (1/n)^\alpha$ which we need to be $< 1/m$.
    So we choose $1/n < \sqrt[\alpha]{\frac{1}{Mm}}$ since $M, \alpha$ are defined and $\alpha > 0$
    we can compute this for any $1/m$ as required.
\end{proof}



\problem{2} 7.6.3 Problem 5

Give an example of a sequence that is uniformly equicontinuous 
but not uniformly bounded

\problem{3} 7.6.3 Problem 6

Prove that the family of all polynomials of degree $\leq N$ with
coefficients in $[-1,1]$ is uniformly bounded and uniformly
equicontinuous on any compact interval. 

\textbf{Hint: }
Let the compact interval be $[a, b]$, and each polynomial in the family has the form

$p(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + \dots + c_N x^N \sp x \in [a,b], \sp c_i \in [-1, 1], \sp 0 \leq i \leq N$

To prove uniform equicontinuity, show that the derivatives of all polynomials in the 
family are uniformly bounded.

\problem{4} 7.6.3 Problem 9

Give an example of a uniformly bounded and uniformly equicontinuous
sequence of functions on the whole line that does not have any uniformly
convergent subsequences.

\textbf{Hint: } Consider the following sequence of functions on $\reals$

$$f_n(x) = \begin{cases}
    0 & x \leq n-1\\
    x - (n-1) & n-1 < x \leq n\\
    1 & x > n
\end{cases}$$
