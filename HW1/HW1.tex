\problem{1} 6.1.5 Problem 3

Derive the integration of the derivative theorem from the differentiation of 
the integral theorem. Can you prove the converse implication?

You \textbf{don't} need to prove the converse case. Here, assume the differentiation of the integral
theorem is true, namely,

$$\frac{d}{dx} \int_a ^x g(t) dt = g(x)$$

for any continuous function $g(x)$ on $[a,b]$ and $a \leq x \leq b$, you need to use this to prove:

$$\int_a ^b f'(x) dx = f(b) - f(a)$$

for any $C^1$ function $f$ on $[a,b]$.

\textbf{Hint:} Consider function

$$G(x) = \int_a ^x f'(t)dt, \sp a \leq x \leq b$$
and see how $G(x)$ and $f(x)$ are related.

\problem{2} 6.1.5 Problem 4

Prove the integral mean value theorem: if $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ then there exists $y$ in $(a,b)$ 
such that $\int_a ^b f(x) dx = (b - a)f(y)$

\problem{3} 6.1.5 Problem 8

Let $f$ be a $C^1$ function on the line, and let $g(x) = \int_0 ^1 f(xy)y^2 dy$.
Prove that $g$ is a $C^1$ function and establish a formula for $g'(x)$ in terms of $f$

\textbf{Hint:} Use theorem 6.1.7

\problem{4} 6.1.5 Problem 10

For a continuous, positive function $w(x)$ on $[a,b]$, define the weighted average operator $A_w$ to be:

$$A_w(f) = \frac{ \int_a ^b f(x) w(x) dx }{ \int_a ^b w(x) dx}$$

for continuous functions $f$. Prove that $A_w$ is linear and lies between the maximum and mininum values of $f$.

\textbf{Hint:} $A_w$ is linear if
$$A_w (c_1 f + c_2 g) = c_1 A_w (f) + c_2 A_w (g)$$
for any constants $c_1, c_2$ and continuous functions $f,g$ on $[a,b]$
